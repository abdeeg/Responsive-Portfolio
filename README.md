# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Task

This week, we'll build a portfolio page, which we can add to as the course progresses.

A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after a boot camp.

## Customising the HTML

The first step I did in this challenge was set up a new github repository and then copied over the starter code files over into here so that I can get started on initializing my repo.

I then proceeded to use **Git Add**, **Git Commit** and **Git Push** to push my code onto the repo I created earlier to then start comitting my code bit by bit while I work on the challenge.

The next step for me was to get the layout of the HTML. I made the following additions:

- Changed the title and relevant headers to reflect my personal work
- Added Anchor tags in the Nav to link back to the relevant sections of the page later down the line
- Made sure to include Paragraph tags in the 'About Me' section and filled with lorem ipsum text as a placeholder
- Added more Anchor and Div tags in the 'Work' section of the page to prepare for the styling of the different project examples.
- Lastly more Anchor tags in the 'Contact Me' section with the aim of adding a fake phone number and email as a placeholder and then to add my Github and LinkedIn links towards the end of the challenge.

## Customising the CSS

The bulk of my time spent on this challenge was on the CSS style sheet.

Here I worked on:

- Adding the Root at the top of my sheet to reference back my Primary, Secondary and Tertiary colours to be used across my page
- Inserting my flex containers and items
- Setting up the media query so that my page also looks great when rendered on mobile
- Using hover animations over the nav and contact me sections of my page
- And so much more.
